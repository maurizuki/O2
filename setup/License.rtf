\pard\widctlpar\sb100\sa100\qj\b0\scaps0\fs26 All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License.

If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).\par

\pard\widctlpar\sb100\sa100\b\scaps\fs32 3.4. Notices\par

You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\par

\pard\widctlpar\sb100\sa100\b\scaps\fs37 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\par

Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\par

However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\par
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\~2.1 of this License shall terminate.\par
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections\~5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\par

\pard\widctlpar\sb100\sa100\b\scaps\fs37 7. Limitation of Liability\par

This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party\rquote s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\highlight0\par

\pard\widctlpar\sb100\sa100\b\scaps\fs37 8. Litigation\par

\pard\widctlpar\sb100\sa100\qj\b0\scaps0\fs26 Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party\rquote s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\par

\pard\widctlpar\sb100\sa100\b\scaps\fs37 9. Miscellaneous\par

\pard\widctlpar\sb100\sa100\qj\b0\scaps0\fs26 This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\par
